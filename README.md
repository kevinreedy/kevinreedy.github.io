### Hey, I'm Kevin Reedy!
Greetings Internet! This repo is used to generate my website, [kevinreedy.net](https://kevinreedy.net). When changes are merged, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) kicks off a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) build and pushes the result to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The site is then served up using [Amazon Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) over TLS with a certificate generated by [Amazon Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/).
