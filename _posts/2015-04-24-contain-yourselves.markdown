title: "Contain Yourselves: Let's get Docker into production"

Docker is undoubtably one of the most talked about infrastructure technologies of the last year. It's easy to find hundreds of blog posts, tweets, and tech talks around how it will revolutionize how we write and deploy code. While there is an overwhelming amount of information about getting started and using it to simplify development, not many people are talking about they've succeeded or struggled with getting containers into production.

In this Lightning talk at [DevOpsDays Rockies](http://www.devopsdaysrox.org/), I gave extremely brief introductions to tools you may want to use to get containers running in production, including [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) (including etcd and fleet), [Amazon EC2 Container Service](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/), [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/), [Google Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), [Deis](http://deis.io/), and [Flynn](https://flynn.io/).
