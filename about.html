    <h3>Hey, I'm Kevin Reedy!</h3>
    <p>I'm an engineer and founder from Chicago, working on my own product company - <a href="https://recrec.io">RecRec</a>. Previously, I've worked for <a href="https://konghq.com/">Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>, <a href="https://www.bellycard.com">Belly</a>, and <a href="https://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a>. I'm a founding board member of <a href="https://devopsdayschi.org/">DevOpsDays Chicago</a> and <a href="https://www.illinoisshuffleboard.org/">The Illinois Shuffleboard Association</a>.</p>

    <p>With RecRec, I'm taking everything I've learned about building communities, and I'm using it to build products and relationships that can strengthen recreational sports groups.</p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy, Playing Shuffleboard (currently ranked #20 in the world), Cycling, Cooking, Brewing Beer, and promising myself that I'll update my Blog more often.
      You can also find me on <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kevinreedy">Github</a>, <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://hachyderm.io/@kevinreedy">Mastodon</a>, and <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kevinreedy">Twitter</a>.
